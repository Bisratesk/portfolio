          <h2>BISRAT ESKEATNAF</h2>
          <P class="hello">      
            I'm a third-year Computer Science student on a mission to master the art of full-stack development.
             Coding isnot just a skill for meâ€”it is my passion, my playground, and my puzzle. 
             From crafting sleek front-end interfaces to building rock-solid back-end architectures, 
             I am all about turning ideas into reality with clean, efficient, and scalable code.  
            I thrive in team settings, where collaboration fuels creativity. 
            Whether it is brainstorming in a hackathon, pair-programming to crush bugs,
             or hyping up teammates during late-night sprints, I bring positive energy and a problem-solving mindset to the table.
              My goal? To grow into a top-tier developer who creates seamless, impactful user experiences while inspiring and learning from those around me.  
            Let us all code the future, one commit at a time. </P>
